#### What Matters to Us
Enzyme was started to help companies get cutting edge, quality technology to patients faster. We strive to facilitate this for our customers by providing best-in-class information and tooling.

#### Why Enzyme?
After spending a decade each in the medical device industry, our founders Jared and Jacob grew exhausted with the status quo day-to-day Quality Management System (QMS) activities and submission generation. 

Jacob used a plethora of QMS software tools for routine tasks (i.e. different tools for the varied elements of a QMS), and many users either 1) had partial/no access to all systems or 2) had significant difficulty using many systems due to infrequent access. This resulted in delays to getting work done amounting to weeks or months for a single project and ultimately to millions of work-hours per year across an enterprise. Enzyme combines and integrates workflows to significantly reduce the work-hours necessary to accomplish project objectives.

Jared co-founded a consulting firm before Enzyme that specifically aided companies in submission generation. While doing that, he learned of the immense waste of resources that companies invested in submission writing. 

Both Jared and Jacob share a vision of a unifying QMS tool that streamlines numerous workflows and assists in document creation through auto-generation via Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing features.

Too often good product ideas fail to commercialize due to what seems to be an overwhelming compliance and regulatory burden. The Enzyme cloud-hosted QMS application greatly reduces the work needed to accomplish the same deliverables. Per its namesake, Enzyme acts as a catalyst, or force-multiplier, to help get products to market faster.

#### Our Mission
Enzyme’s mission is to help life science companies commercialize faster without compromising patient care. We foster a culture of quality through modern software tools and expert guidance.  

Our goal is to reduce the time and cost life science companies spend during the product development life cycle. Through our product, education, and support, we help companies commercialize faster.

For strategic accounts, we offer Regulatory and/or Quality consulting services, or “RaaS” and “QaaS” respectively). Through the Quality services, we provide support to companies as they set up their QMS and train their users. We can also provide internal audit support to help ensure they are ready for FDA inspections and Notified Body (the FDA equivalents in the European Union) audits. 

As part of our regulatory services, we can help companies prepare their pre-submissions and full submissions for the FDA or a Notified Body. 

#### How We Operate
Enzyme is a Remote First organization. Processes and tooling are set up to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability across the organization, regardless of whether an employee is on-site or remote. Since the Spring of 2020 when the Covid pandemic began, Enzyme ceased having a dedicated HQ work space in SF. We maintain a shared workspace in South San Francisco that can be used by local employees, but it is primarily maintained for business address purposes.

Remote team members can work from anywhere during normal business hours as long as they are available online for calls. 

#### Management
* All-hands meetings are held monthly to discuss progress updates, announcements, discussions of hot topics, and an open Q&A forum.
* Monthly Retro meetings are also held to collect feedback on the +s and -s the organization experienced over that time period.
* Developer team meetings occur weekly.
* Operations team meetings (all other staff outside the development team) also occur weekly.
* Managers typically hold direct 1:1 meetings weekly or as appropriate.

##### Individual Performance Review
   Possible agenda for routine 1-on-1 meetings:
   
- Review context:
    - Personal context
    - Key business updates
 - Performance versus OKRs (when applicable)
 - Feedback about organizational systems & processes (not shared in company retro meetings)
 - Performance feedback for management; start/stop/continue
 - Career planning; near-term & long-term
 
 Annual Reviews take place in December/January.

#### Our Office
* Enzyme CA billing address and 'HQ': 611 Gateway Blvd Ste 120, South San Francisco, CA 94080. 

##### Focused Work and Asynchronous Communication
- We support being “in the zone” ([deep focused work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d66815uVerk))
- We capture and track work in organized tasks
- We communicate openly in shared digital forums (Slack)

Our employees work varied hours from many global locations. This creates several asynchronous workflows that we strive to use to our advantage and allows great autonomy for individual contributors. Team and all-hands meetings are generally clustered during centralized ‘core hours’ so all who are needed can attend as per their normal work schedules.

We believe HIGHLY in the lesson of [this cartoon](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/) by [@detly](https://github.com/detly)

It’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if we collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. The preferred first choice of action should be to post a message, a to-do, or a document about what we need explained or need to know. Then others can respond when they’re available.

There are exceptions. Extended, synchronous collaborations sometimes are needed. We use Slack, Zoom, and in-person collaboration when appropriate. 

Teams that collaborate heavily should plan for more overlap. Async should bias for deep (aka Deep Work) concentration time, thereby improving productivity.

* Communication Norms    
We use Slack as our main tool for communication. During their respective business hours, all employees should be available via Slack. 

* AFK (Away From Keyboard)    
Life happens, just notify your team on Slack and/or via the Enzyme Shared calendar that you won’t be available and for approximately how long.

#### Enzyme IRL (In Real Life)

Once in the summer and once in winter we all gather to build relationships and share key updates. The Covid pandemic interrupted this practice, preventing IRLs in 2020 and 2021, but we are looking forward to resuming these in 2022.

This is an important complement to our remote-first, distributed structure. While attendance is not strictly mandatory, every effort is made to schedule these events to accommodate all employees' schedules and travel needs. IRLs typically last 3-5 days with at least one 'off-site' event day. Dinners are typically together, and we try to keep meeting days to a ~9am-3:30pm schedule to allow for some normal work activities and/or free time.

#### Tools we Use
To successfully build our product, there are several tools we use on a daily basis.

**Everyone**
 - 1Password - Password management tool for business and personal use. All employees receive a standard business account which also allows you to create a family share account for free (up to 5 personal account users). It is Enzyme policy that all employees must use 1Password for business-related logins; we also share some logins internally via several Vaults that you are given access to on an as-needed basis. Upon separation from Enzyme, it is an easy process to decouple the family share account from the corporate account and to take on the monthly fee for personal use only. Similarly, if you already have a 1Password personal account, it's easy to link it to the business account and subsequently receive the free benefit.
 
 - Jira - Atlassian tool - Epics, enhancements, bugs & tasks are tracked in Jira to log and track product improvements and other projects. There are several active Boards at any given time. We have routine calls to groom, review and plant sprint tasks from the main QMSC Jira board, and sometimes other boards as well.

- Confluence - Atlassian tool - Used for internal communication, unofficial documentation, release planning including release notes.

- Zoom - Video/audio conferencing for internal & external calls. For team meetings, please plan to have your camera on as much as [possible](https://twitter.com/fredsters_s/status/1189940262203617280?s=20).

- Slack - Used most commonly for daily communication within the team and some of our customers. In support of Remote-First, async culture, please be mindful to use appropriately scoped channels. Even conversations amongst people in the office might take place over Slack, as to record it for posterity or make available to remote teams.

 - G Suite - We use Gmail and Google Calendar, and much of our documentation is hosted on Google Drive.

 - Microsoft Office Suite - we use Word and PowerPoint for certain internal purposes and with certain customers. Our internal QMS procedures' native files are typically MS Office Suite filetypes.

- Brex - Company business credit card services. Employees are issued an electronic credit card that you can access via the Brex website and when you download their app to your phone. Physical cards can be issued upon request.

**Product Development**

 - Figma - a 2D design tool we use to create user interface mocks for our product.

 - TBD - In 2022, we will be enbarking on a UI update across the app where we'll be utilizing (most likely) a full time designer who may introduce additional tooling.

**Customer Operations & Marketing**
 - Hubspot - Customer Relationship Management software & marketing automation

 - Intercom - chat tool used to manage leads on our website and handle questions in-app. Intercom also hosts our support center with hundreds of Support Articles and eCourses used during the Customer Onboarding process and routine reference by users.

 - Front - auxillary email client, allowing us to easily collaborate on responding to shared email inboxes such as support@ and sales@enzyme.com

 - Webflow - a web content management systems we use primarily for our marketing site.
