#### Using this Handbook
This handbook provides an overview of our company, what drives us, and how we operate. After reading this handbook, reach out to your manager to clarify any questions you may have. We have done our best to give you a glimpse into Enzyme; let us know if you feel something is missing. 

#### What Matters to Us
Enzyme was started to help companies get cutting edge technology to patients faster. We want to be open and transparent with our customers, and we help educate them so they can deliver the best product.

#### Why Enzyme?
After spending a decade each in the medical device industry, both Jared and Jacob grew exhausted with the status quo with respect to day-to-day QMS activities and submission generation. 

Jacob used, on average, 5 different QMS software tools for day-to-day tasks (e.g. different tools for various elements of the QMS), and many users either 1) had partial/no access to all systems or 2) had significant difficulty using several systems due to infrequent access. This resulted in delays to getting work done on the order of multiple weeks/year for the broader team all supporting one project. Multiply this by thousands of projects in a large organization, and this translates into a significant resource drain and project delays.

Jared co-founded a consulting firm before Enzyme that specifically aided companies in submission generation. While doing that, he learned of the immense waste of resources that companies invested in submission writing. 

Both Jared and Jacob share a vision of a unifying QMS tool that simplifies and streamlines numerous workflows and assists in document creation through auto-generated Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing driven features.

Too often good product ideas fail to commercialize due to what seems to be an overwhelming compliance and regulatory burden. The Enzyme cloud-hosted QMS greatly reduces the work needed to accomplish the same deliverables. Per its namesake, Enzyme acts as a catalyst, or force-multiplier, to help get products to market faster.

#### Our Mission
Enzyme's mission is to help life science companies commercialize faster without compromising patient care. We foster a culture of quality through modern software tools and expert guidance.  

Our goal is to reduce the time and cost life science companies spend during the product development life cycle. Through our product, education, and support, we help companies commercialize faster.
