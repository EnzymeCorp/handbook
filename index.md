#### What Matters to Us
Enzyme was started to help companies get cutting edge, quality technology to patients faster. We strive to facilitate this for our customers by providing best-in-class information and tooling.

#### Why Enzyme?
After spending a decade each in the medical device industry, our founders Jared and Jacob grew exhausted with the status quo day-to-day Quality Management System (QMS) activities and submission generation. 

Jacob used a plethora of QMS software tools for routine tasks (i.e. different tools for the varied elements of a QMS), and many users either 1) had partial/no access to all systems or 2) had significant difficulty using many systems due to infrequent access. This resulted in delays to getting work done amounting to weeks or months for a single project and ultimately to millions of work-hours per year across an enterprise. Enzyme combines and integrates workflows to significantly reduce the work-hours necessary to accomplish project objectives.

Jared co-founded a consulting firm before Enzyme that specifically aided companies in submission generation. While doing that, he learned of the immense waste of resources that companies invested in submission writing. 

Both Jared and Jacob share a vision of a unifying QMS tool that streamlines numerous workflows and assists in document creation through auto-generation via Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing features.

Too often good product ideas fail to commercialize due to what seems to be an overwhelming compliance and regulatory burden. The Enzyme cloud-hosted QMS application greatly reduces the work needed to accomplish the same deliverables. Per its namesake, Enzyme acts as a catalyst, or force-multiplier, to help get products to market faster.

#### Our Mission
Enzyme’s mission is to help life science companies commercialize faster without compromising patient care. We foster a culture of quality through modern software tools and expert guidance.  

Our goal is to reduce the time and cost life science companies spend during the product development life cycle. Through our product, education, and support, we help companies commercialize faster.

#### What We Offer To Customers

##### eQMS Web Application
A SaaS application that encodes a depth of quality & regulatory business processes that is thoughtfully integrated & friendly to novices and pros alike.

##### Quality System Document Library
A Full QMS set of procedures compliant to regulations & standards to which medical device companies must comply.

##### Services
For strategic accounts, we offer Regulatory and/or Quality consulting services, or “RaaS” and “QaaS” respectively). Through the Quality services, we provide support to companies as they set up their QMS and train their users. We can also provide internal audit support to help ensure they are ready for FDA inspections and Notified Body (the FDA equivalents in the European Union) audits. 

As part of our regulatory services, we can help companies prepare their pre-submissions and full submissions for the FDA or a Notified Body. 

#### How We Operate
Enzyme is a Remote First organization. Processes and tooling are set up to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability across the organization, regardless of whether an employee is on-site or remote. 

Employees local to the SF Bay Area have the option to work from HQ. However, employees can work remotely from home, a coffee shop, or wherever they are most efficient, provided their work is getting done. 

For the 100% remote team members, they can work from anywhere during business hours as long as they are available online for calls. 

#### Performance Mangement (aka Objectives & Keys Results, OKRs)
* Each quarter the team will develop and publish OKRs
* Updates will be made as appropriate as the quarter ensues.
* All-hands meetings that are typically bi-weekly include OKR progress updates, announcements, discussions of hot topics, and an open Q&A forum.

##### Individual Performance Review
   As per best practices and quality system procedures Enzyme continuously assesses competence. This is a suggested agenda for routine 1-on-1 meetings:
   
- Review context:
    - Personal context
    - Key business updates
 - Performance versus OKRs
 - Feedback about organizational systems & processes (not shared in company retro meetings)
 - Performance feedback for management; start/stop/continue
 - Career planning; near-term & long-term
 
 This will be summarized in an annual review.

#### Our Office
* Enzyme HQ (headquarters): 611 Gateway Blvd Ste 120, South San Francisco, CA 94080. 

##### Focused Work and Asynchronous Communication
- We support being in “in the zone” ([deep focused work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD7dXfdDPfg))
- We capture and track work in organized tasks
- We communicate openly in shared digital forums (Slack)

Our employees work varied hours from many global locations. This creates several asynchronous workflows that we strive to use to our advantage and allows great autonomy for individual contributors. Team and all-hands meetings are generally clustered during centralized ‘core hours’ so all who are needed can attend as per their normal work schedules.

We believe HIGHLY in the lesson of [this cartoon](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/) by [@detly](https://github.com/detly)

It’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if we collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. The preferred first choice of action should be to post a message, a to-do, or a document about what we need explained or need to know. Then others can respond when they’re available.

There are exceptions. Extended, synchronous collaborations sometimes are needed. We use Slack, Zoom, and in-person collaboration when appropriate. 

Teams that collaborate heavily should plan for more overlap. Async should bias for deep (aka Deep Work) concentration time, thereby improving productivity.

* Communication Norms    
We use Slack as our main tool for communication. During their respective business hours, all employees should be available via Slack. 

* AFK (Away From Keyboard)    
Life happens, just notify your team on Slack and/or via the Enzyme Shared calendar that you won’t be available and for approximately how long.

#### Enzyme IRL (In Real Life)

Once in the summer and once in winter we all gather to build relationships and share key updates. 

This is an important complement to our remote-first, distributed structure.

- Slack - Used most commonly for daily communication within the team and some of our customers. In support of Remote-First, async culture, please be mindful to use appropriately scoped channels.
